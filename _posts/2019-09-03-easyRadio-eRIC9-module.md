I wrote a simple to use C library for connecting and sending information between
two easyRadio eRIC9 modules. This project was for testing purposes and is not currently 
being actively maintained, although do I hope to come back to it one day. 


Built-in functions:
	* Temperature sensor
	* CRC


The documentation can be found [here](https://jyang772.github.io/eRIC-linux/).
