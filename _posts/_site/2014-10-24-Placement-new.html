<p>I am still intrigued by the use of malloc() and “placement new” to create objects on the heap in C++. This allows you to construct an object at a particular location in memory. Basically memory that has already been allocated.</p>

<p>Malloc() only allocates the requested amount of memory and returns a pointer to it. Whereas, new combines mallac() with a call to the object’s constructor which initializes the object.  In order to use malloc() with a class, you would have to explicitly call the objects constructor. As well as explicitly calling the object’s destructor!!!</p>

<p>Please do not use placement new unless you really need to place an object in a specific part of memory.</p>
